Below are the prompts that I entered into ChatGPT to generate this app. Your results may vary.

generate the HTML and CSS for a professional dog grooming website that offers multiple services. Each service should have a description. There should be a form on the page that allows users to request the available service. The form should contain fields for the user's name, phone number, email, a date picker, and a time picker. and a long text field for notes. The form should be set up to submit the data to a JS server.

implement a server for the form endpoint using Node.js and Express. The server should also use cors and dotenv. The server should submit the form data to a MongoDB Atlas database using an asynchronous function. The MongoDB connection information is stored in an environment variable called MONGODB_URI. Add a console log to confirm whether the mongoDB connection was successful

update the server to use mongoose to save the form data to MongoDB. The save function should be asynchronous and should use try/catch blocks to handle errors.

The server should render a static file called index.html as the homepage.

instead of res.sendStatus(200);, please redirect back to the homepage. Also, add a console log to show the contents of the serviceRequest variable

add express.urlencoded middleware

create a function to send all data from the servicerequests collection, sorted by date and time, to an EJS page called admin.ejs and add ejs as the view engine

create an admin.ejs page to list the service requests

update the navbar on the homepage to link to the admin page

add a button to the admin page which redirects to the home page

convert the serviceRequest.date from a datetime to mm/dd/yyyy format

the table on the admin page should have banded rows and borders around each cell. Also, add a button that links back to the homepage below the header.

add validation to the form on the static homepage with no EJS so that users cannot select a date prior to the current day
